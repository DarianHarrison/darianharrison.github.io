In this blog post, we will cover a guideline on what to look out for when thinking about locating a bioprocess plant.

It is almost impossible to find the perfect location, so here we will just provide a master reference of things to consider and look out for when thinking about this concept.

In bioprocess engineering, we often obsess over "Day 1"—the ribbon cutting. But the real test of a site isn't Day 1. It’s Day 2. Day 2 is when the first heatwave hits the local grid, or when a wildfire 200 miles away clogs your HEPA filters [1].

It is definitely worth thinking very carefully about this because usually a plant will require a significant investment, so it's generally a good idea to carefully assess and evaluate strategic advantages and disadvantages.

An attempt has been made to rank these factors in their order of importance using a "Weighted Scoring Model". I hope that this provides guidance on what ideas or concepts to consider when it's your time to think about these concepts.

## Site Selection Master Reference

### Binary Gates (The "Must-Haves")
*Before applying any scoring, a site must pass these binary gates. If a site fails a Gate, it is eliminated immediately, regardless of its price.*

| Gate Category | Critical "Day 2" Requirement | The "Day 2" Failure Scenario (STOP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zoning** | **Group H Occupancy**<br>Must legally allow storage of hazardous solvents (ethanol/acetonitrile) for ADCs/mRNA [1]. | **The "Science Park" Trap**<br>Zoning limits solvent storage to R&D levels (e.g., <500L). You build the shell but cannot legally operate at commercial scale [1]. |
| **Power** | **Confirmed Capacity**<br>Grid capacity (MW) must be confirmed in the interconnection queue, not just promised [1, 2]. | **The "Theoretical" MW**<br>The utility promises power, but the queue is booked for 3+ years by hyperscale Data Centers [2]. |
| **Air Quality** | **HVAC Design Limit**<br>Intake air quality (PM2.5) must not exceed the HVAC system's worst-case design capacity [1, 4]. | **Filtration Failure**<br>A wildfire event spikes PM2.5, clogging pre-filters in hours and causing positive pressure loss in the cleanroom [4]. |
| **Water** | **Priority Allocation**<br>Legal priority for Water for Injection (WFI) feed during drought conditions [1]. | **Curtailment**<br>In a drought, priority is legally assigned to residential or semiconductor assets over biopharma [2]. |

### The Weighted Scoring Matrix
*We categorize selection factors into three tiers based on their impact on operational resilience.*

* **Tier 1: The Existential Drivers (Weight: 50%)**
    * These are binary "showstoppers"—a deficiency here is existential.
    * In biopharma, labor is a specialized asset, not a commodity.
    * The most profound error is prioritizing low wages over talent density, or cheap power over grid stability.

* **Tier 2: Standard Industrial Factors (Weight: 30%)**
    * These factors impact ROI (OpEx/CapEx) but are usually manageable through engineering or budget adjustments.
    * While important for the bottom line, a failure here rarely shuts down the plant—it just makes it more expensive to run.

* **Tier 3: The "Hidden" Outliers (Weight: 20%)**
    * These are emerging risks usually missed in standard checklists but often derail operations in the long term.
    * This includes "Black Swan" events like wildfire smoke events or geopolitical shifts in IP law.

| Tier | Category | Weight | Critical "Day 2" Risk | Key Indicators / Red Flags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **Talent Ecosystem**<br>Access to GMP workforce, specialized trades, and "Bio-computation" talent [1]. | **20%** | **Inability to Scale**<br>You cannot hire 50+ GMP staff quickly to replace turnover, leading to production halts. | • **Red Flag:** Isolated Greenfield (Zero local talent base).<br>• **Indicator:** Presence of "Bio-computation" academic hubs. |
| **Tier 1** | **Regulatory & Quality**<br>Inspection history, Data Integrity culture, and Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) [1, 3]. | **15%** | **Audit Hell**<br>A local culture of data fraud triggers constant, intrusive regulatory inspections [3]. | • **Red Flag:** Non-MRA Jurisdiction (Duplicative inspections).<br>• **Indicator:** Strong regional ALCOA+ track record. |
| **Tier 1** | **Utility Resilience**<br>Grid stability ("Five Nines"), water security, and resource competition [1, 2]. | **15%** | **Batch Loss**<br>Micro-glitches desynchronize Digital Twins; capacity is unavailable due to Data Centers [2]. | • **Red Flag:** "Sold Out" Grid (Queue >3 years).<br>• **Indicator:** Low SAIDI/SAIFI power outage metrics. |
| **Tier 2** | **Construction Economics**<br>Material costs ("Bio-Premium"), zoning speed, and exit liquidity [1]. | **12%** | **Schedule Collapse**<br>High-purity pipefitters are drained by a neighboring Semiconductor Fab project [2]. | • **Red Flag:** Located near a new "CHIPS Act" mega-project.<br>• **Indicator:** High "Exit Liquidity" (Can we sell the building?). |
| **Tier 2** | **Operating Costs (OpEx)**<br>Energy rates, fully loaded labor costs, and tax efficiency [1, 5]. | **10%** | **False Economy**<br>Low hourly wages are erased by high error rates and retraining costs [3]. | • **Red Flag:** High Churn (>20% turnover).<br>• **Indicator:** Tax credits structured as QRTCs (Pillar Two friendly) [5]. |
| **Tier 2** | **Logistics**<br>Cold chain integrity and Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) status [1]. | **8%** | **Product Loss**<br>Temperature excursions occur during the "last mile" transport to the airport. | • **Red Flag:** Airport lacks pharma-grade freezer farms.<br>• **Indicator:** <60 min drive to international air hub. |
| **Tier 3** | **Micro-Climate & ESG**<br>Wildfire smoke, agricultural spores, and biodiversity reporting [1, 4]. | **10%** | **Filtration Tax**<br>Wildfire smoke events spike filter OpEx by 400% and force downtime [4]. | • **Red Flag:** Siting in a high-fire risk zone without HVAC redundancy.<br>• **Indicator:** EU CSRD biodiversity compliance. |
| **Tier 3** | **Geopolitics**<br>Market access mandates and IP sovereignty [1]. | **10%** | **Market Lock-Out**<br>"Buy Local" mandates force the use of inferior local suppliers. | • **Red Flag:** Forced Tech Transfer requirements.<br>• **Indicator:** "Made in Ally" labeling for US/EU market access. |

### Conclusion

In my view, it seems like the mindset you need to have is to think about the day-to-day operational maintenance of the facility. It's useful to think about this because it allows you to question Day 2 operations: when things are not always new and shiny, what will that look like? Does it look feasible?

We must move from a Cost-Centric approach to a Resilience-Centric one [1]. The era of globalization, characterized by frictionless trade, has dissolved. In its place, we have a new geometry defined by resource competition—where biopharma must compete with semiconductor fabs for water and data centers for power [2].

Ideally, you want to prioritize ecosystems over islands. The "Talent Magnet" effect of established clusters provides a form of resilience that cheap land cannot replicate [1].

That's it for this post. Hopefully, organizing all these factors into this master reference provides a clearer view of how to navigate the complex landscape of site selection.
