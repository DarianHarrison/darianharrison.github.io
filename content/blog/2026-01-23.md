In this blog post, we will cover how to plan the networking and communication layer to enable automated workflows.

In any process automation, numerous components must coordinate to execute units of work. Simultaneously, we need visibility into the state of the overall system.

To give a specific example, you might have various motors powering different types of work, such as pumping, draining, lifting, pressurizing, pushing, or grabbing. On the other hand, you need visibility into the health of each specific motor or system, alongside areas that require specific environmental conditions—like temperature, humidity, or light—which must be captured via sensor devices.

Whenever we plan a new process automation design, we must consider how each system, subsystem, module, and component will communicate throughout the entire processing plant.

Ideally, we want to operate our plant remotely. This means we must be able to modify control parameters for specific motors or receive telemetry data from different sensors from a distance. To navigate this complexity, it is best to group each device, system, and unit into specific categories.

Below is a reference guide for organizing these layers.

### Conclusion

This approach prioritizes the network and communication strategy. I'd argue that this is the first and most important level of a truly automated system.

There may be some components that don't fit into a specific group, or span multiple groups, however this is just a high level to begin to think how to achieve a fully automated industrial plant. Furthermore, each use case or specific application will require its own specifications, and this is just a ballpark to give an idea.

Although we will not cover this here, it is important to note that securing each protocol should be carefully thought through, and security considerations should be considered at every layer based on its best practices.

That's it for this post. Hopefully, organizing all the components into these blocks provides a clearer view of how to organize and fully control and monitor every component of your automated process.
