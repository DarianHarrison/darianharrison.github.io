I've decided to try a new experiment this year: documenting my journey into bioprocess automation.

Over the past few years, I've been researching bioprocesses and find the field quite fascinating. Because of this, I've decided to take on the challenge of pursuing it more actively.

The idea is to maintain a bi-weekly blog post to briefly document whatever I may be working on throughout the year.

This experiment is mostly meant to help me stay the course. This field of study is quite broad, messy, and complex, so I expect to always have something to write about.

With that, let's go.
